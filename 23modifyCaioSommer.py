#You can combine variables with strings in an output

name1 = "Axl"
name2 = "Slash"
#Add 2 more variables to store 'Duff' and 'Izzy'


# The following print line uses concatenation to join variables and strings together.
# Modify the line to join the four names variables together with an additional string
# to create an appropriate sentance.
print(name1 + " and " + name2 + " and ")

# The next line produces the same output as the previous print statemtn,
# but uses an 'f' string technique to form the final string.
# Modify the code to produce the same output as the previous print
# statement.
print(f"{name1} and {name2} and ")
